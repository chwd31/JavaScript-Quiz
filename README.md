# Quiz_Challenge

Students were tasked to create a JavaScript quiz using what we have learned about HTML, CSS, and JS.  The task required the creation of game play with a timer and a page to store and display high scores.  The game also has a time penalty for incorrect answers and the score is the time the user took to answer all the questions correctly. 

## Installation

The JavaScript Quiz can be found at https://chwd31.github.io/Quiz_Challenge/  

No other installation is necessary.

## Usage
This game is for use by anyone to test their JS knowledge. 
User start the game by clicking the start button.
User will read the question and click on one of the provided choices.
If the user chooses the correct answer, the game will move to the next question.
If the user chooses the incorrect answer, the game will penalize them 15 seconds and allow them to choose another answer.
Game play ends when the user answer all the questions or runs out of time. 
The user can then place their initials in for addition to the score board.
The score will be saved in the user's local storage, and can be cleared.
